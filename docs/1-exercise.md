## Questions To Ask Yourself

Try to keep it simple to start:

1. Think of 3 **moments in time** that were meaningful to this story. 
1. Think of 3 **locations** that were meaningful to this story.
1. Think of 3 **growth moments** that were meaningful to this story.
1. Think of **the next destination** you want to reach with this story.

Here are some questions to help you think about this:
- What was the date? Was that date important?
- What was the location? Was that location important?
- How did you feel? (then and now)
- What did you learn? (then and now)
- What did you do (to celebrate or to move forward)?
- **How does that contribute to your hero's journey?**
 
Think not just about what to include - but what to leave out. _Declutter timelines and story maps to keep the desired journey in focus._ We can then use the key dates, locations, insights and emotions - to build a narrative that resonates with our audience.
